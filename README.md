# Word Generator

## The Idea

The intial idea of this project came out of an question. Can a program invent a word concatenating a bunch of letters such that this make up word looks like something from an actual language?

Initially, I would like to understand more why it looks like some words "belong" to a language. A human may be able to distinguish words from Mandarin from Swedish without prior knowledge from both languages. They also could for instance identify if a spoken word belongs to the Chinese language or Norse. From this small example, I understand that most languages have some sort of set of "rules" that dictates its general pronunciation. I would like to create a program that is capable of creating a word that sounds it could belong to any idiom, give sufficient information.

## The Program

This project takes as input a dictionary of words, from which it compiles a frequency table, and a markov chain probability of the next word based on the previous word.

This table is then used as a basis for the creation process of a word.

## Future Work

There is a lot to be done. Further improvements of the analysis algorithm and the creation process must be performed. I would also like to create a machine learning process to improve the process provided sufficient time to develop such feature.
